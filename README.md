# StarWarsTrivia

This is my first real project meaning, my first original idea I just started writing and had fun witing, and really understood everything I was writing. I plan on adding to this project because I found the SWAPI fun to play with and had a lot of data, and sparked other additions I want to have for this little project.

## Things To Improve
* clean up code
* add a character search feature
* fix a bug with my loader
* optimize the code a little better
* fix guess checking with dialect and accent marks
* add a retry option

### Installing
Plain and simple just clone the repo into a folder and just drag the index.html file into a new tab.
